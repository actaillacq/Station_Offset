description=This plugin computes the station and offset of points along polylines and exports those values to csv for other applications
version=1.1.2
author=Tailwater Limited
email=applications@tailwaterlimited.com

about=This plugin creates a .csv file containing the station and offset of all points in a point feature layer for each polyline in a polyline feature layer. This is useful to convert three-dimensional survey data to two dimensional survey data (station/offset).

changelog= 1.0.1 Updated file structure to fix issue with folder structure after moving to github.
 Cleaned up code to use the distance calculator in all places.
 Added the option to identify lines by numbers. Adjusted label to identify polylines along with alignments to be more apparent to gis users.
 Added check for point falling on the line segment and fixed issue with the perpendicular slope (forgot minus sign).
 1.0.3 Fixed error related to converting QVariant to QString on output.
 1.0.4 Updated code to reduce the number of lines written to the log file because this was causing QGIS to hang.
 1.1.0 Removed experimental flag added file import function and cross section naming function that calculates stationing from a cl feature.
 Cleaned up files to use streamTools name more appropriately.
 1.1.1 Fixed error when point was used as vertex
 1.1.2 Added support for QT6
